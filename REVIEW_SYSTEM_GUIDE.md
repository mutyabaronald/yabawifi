```

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Backend Setup**
1. Ensure all routes are registered in `server.js`
2. Create necessary Firebase indexes for queries
3. Set up notification collections in Firestore

### **2. Frontend Integration**
1. Import components where needed
2. Add ReviewPopup to post-payment flow
3. Integrate AdminReviewsDashboard into admin panel
4. Add UserReviewsHistory to user dashboard
5. Include AnimatedReviewsDisplay on captive portal

### **3. Database Configuration**
1. Add `reviewsEnabled: true` to hotspot documents
2. Ensure `loyaltyConfig` exists for point awarding
3. Set up proper Firestore security rules

## Configuration Options

### **Hotspot Settings**
```javascript
// In hotspot document
{
  reviewsEnabled: true, // Enable/disable review system
  loyaltyConfig: {
    enabled: true,
    defaultPoints: {
      review: 10, // Points for submitting a review
      // ... other point values
    }
  }
}
```

### **Review Limits**
- One review per user per hotspot per day
- Reviews are soft-deleted (status: 'deleted')
- Admin replies are permanent

## Security Considerations

### **Access Control**
- Admin routes require owner verification
- User routes require phone number verification
- Public routes only show masked information

### **Data Protection**
- Phone numbers masked in public views
- Admin access limited to hotspot owners
- Soft delete prevents data loss

## Testing

   - Verify points are awarded

   - Toggle review system on/off

3. **Public Display**

   - Verify privacy protection
   - Test animations and auto-rotation

4. **Notifications**
