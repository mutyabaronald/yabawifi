# Hotspot-Specific Loyalty System

## Overview
The new loyalty system ensures that **loyalty points are tied to specific WiFi hotspots**, preventing users from cheating by using points earned at one location to get free access at another. Each WiFi owner can configure their own loyalty rates, and points are tracked per hotspot per user.

**Important**: Loyalty points are **ONLY awarded to users who login with their phone number and purchase packages online**. Offline voucher redemptions do not earn loyalty points since they cannot be tracked.

## Key Features

### üîí **Hotspot Isolation**
- **Points are NOT transferable** between different WiFi hotspots
- **Each hotspot has its own loyalty balance** for each user
- **Users can only use points** at the hotspot where they earned them
- **No cross-hotspot point sharing** or cheating possible

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Owner-Configurable Loyalty Rates**
- **Per-package points**: Set specific points for each package type
- **Per-amount points**: Set points per 1000 UGX spent
- **Flexible configuration**: Mix and match both approaches
- **Owner control**: Each WiFi owner sets their own rates

### üìç **Location-Based Tracking**
- **Points tied to hotspot ID**: Not just phone number
- **SSID-based isolation**: Even if same network, different hotspots = different points
- **Geographic separation**: Physical location determines point isolation

### üì± **Online-Only Loyalty**
- **Phone login required**: Users must login with their phone number
- **Online purchases only**: Only mobile money payments earn loyalty points
- **No voucher points**: Offline paper vouchers cannot earn loyalty points
- **Trackable transactions**: All loyalty-earning activities are logged and auditable

## Database Schema

### Collection: `hotspot_loyalty`
```javascript
{
  // Document ID: `${userPhone}_${hotspotId}`
  userPhone: "256771234567",
  hotspotId: "hotspot_123",
  points: 150,                    // Current balance
  totalEarned: 300,              // Total points earned at this hotspot
  totalRedeemed: 150,            // Total points used at this hotspot
  lastEarned: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  lastRedeemed: "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### Collection: `packages` (Updated)
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  loyaltyPointsPerPackage: 50,    // Points awarded per package purchase
  loyaltyPointsPer1000UGX: 10,    // Points per 1000 UGX spent
  loyaltyEnabled: true            // Whether loyalty is enabled for this package
}
```

### Collection: `hotspot_loyalty_transactions`
```javascript
{
  userPhone: "256771234567",
  hotspotId: "hotspot_123",
  type: "earned",                 // "earned" or "redeemed"
  points: 50,                     // Points amount (positive for earned, negative for redeemed)
  reason: "WiFi package purchase: Daily Unlimited",
  packageName: "Daily Unlimited",
  packagePrice: 5000,
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Package Configuration (WiFi Owner)**
```javascript
// WiFi owner sets loyalty rates for their packages
{
  name: "Daily Unlimited",
  price: 5000,
  loyaltyPointsPerPackage: 50,    // 50 points per purchase
  loyaltyPointsPer1000UGX: 10,    // 10 points per 1000 UGX
  loyaltyEnabled: true
}
```

### 2. **Point Awarding (Online Users Only)**
```javascript
// When user logs in with phone and buys package for 5000 UGX:
// - Package points: 50
// - Amount points: Math.floor(5000/1000) * 10 = 50
// - Total: 100 points awarded to THIS hotspot only
// - User must be logged in with phone number to earn points
```

### 3. **Point Usage (Hotspot-Specific)**
```javascript
// User can ONLY use points at the hotspot where they earned them
// - Points earned at "Coffee Shop A" ‚Üí Can only use at "Coffee Shop A"
// - Points earned at "Coffee Shop B" ‚Üí Can only use at "Coffee Shop B"
// - NO cross-transfer possible
```

### 4. **Voucher Redemptions (No Loyalty Points)**
```javascript
// Offline voucher redemptions:
// - User gets free WiFi access
// - NO loyalty points awarded
// - Cannot be tracked for loyalty system
// - Only online mobile money purchases earn points
```

## API Endpoints

### Award Points (Hotspot-Specific)
```
POST /api/users/:phone/loyalty/:hotspotId/award
```
**Body:**
```javascript
{
  points: 100,
  reason: "WiFi package purchase: Daily Unlimited",
  packageName: "Daily Unlimited",
  packagePrice: 5000
}
```

### Redeem Points (Hotspot-Specific)
```
POST /api/users/:phone/loyalty/:hotspotId/redeem
```
**Body:**
```javascript
{
  points: 100,
  packageName: "Daily Unlimited",
  packageValue: 5000
}
```

### Get Loyalty Balance (Hotspot-Specific)
```
GET /api/users/:phone/loyalty/:hotspotId
```

### Get All Loyalty Balances
```
GET /api/users/:phone/loyalty
```

## Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: Coffee Shop A (Online Purchase)
```javascript
// User logs in with phone number
// Package: "Hourly WiFi" - 1000 UGX
// Loyalty: 20 points per package + 15 points per 1000 UGX
// User buys package: 20 + 15 = 35 points earned at Coffee Shop A
```

### Example 2: Coffee Shop B (Online Purchase)
```javascript
// User logs in with phone number
// Package: "Daily WiFi" - 5000 UGX  
// Loyalty: 100 points per package + 20 points per 1000 UGX
// User buys package: 100 + (5 * 20) = 200 points earned at Coffee Shop B
```

### Example 3: Coffee Shop C (Voucher Redemption)
```javascript
// User redeems offline paper voucher
// Package: "Daily WiFi" - 5000 UGX
// Loyalty: 100 points per package + 20 points per 1000 UGX
// User gets: 0 points (vouchers don't earn loyalty points)
// Reason: Cannot track offline voucher redemptions
```

### Example 4: Point Usage
```javascript
// User has:
// - 35 points at Coffee Shop A (from online purchase)
// - 200 points at Coffee Shop B (from online purchase)
// - 0 points at Coffee Shop C (from voucher redemption)

// User can:
// - Use 35 points at Coffee Shop A ‚úÖ
// - Use 200 points at Coffee Shop B ‚úÖ
// - Use Coffee Shop A points at Coffee Shop B ‚ùå (Impossible)
// - Use Coffee Shop B points at Coffee Shop A ‚ùå (Impossible)
// - Use any points at Coffee Shop C ‚ùå (No points earned there)
```
